##HealTrack-IoT-Medication-Monitoring-System

Medication non-adherence is a major challenge in healthcare, particularly for elderly patients
and individuals with chronic illnesses. This project proposes the development of a HealTrack
– an IoT-enabled device designed to remind patients to take their prescribed medicines on time.
The system will feature a medication box with integrated sensors, a buzzer and display for
local alerts, and a web/mobile management interface for caregivers. Notifications, live status
monitoring, and usage logging will improve adherence and support remote supervision.
